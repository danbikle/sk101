The data here was copied from the folder /tmp/sk101/

That folder gets filled with data when I run this script:

/home/ann/sk101/sk101.bash

Perhaps the most interesting data in this folder are these png files:

GBRT:

KNN:

svm.SVR:

LinearRegression:

LogisticRegression:

It appears that LogisticRegression give the best results but GBRT is worth a look.
